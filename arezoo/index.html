    <h2>The Best Chocolate Cake Recipe Ever</h2>
    <h3>yummyyyyyy</h3>
    <p>
      It was great to hear that they thought the cake was just as good after
      their last bite as they thought it was with their first. Here’s another
      great thing about this recipe. The cake batter really can be made in a
      bowl without the use of a heavy duty mixer. Of course, that just makes
      things easier, but this is easily a recipe my Grandmother would have
      enjoyed making in her tiny kitchen with a whisk and a bowl. And I’m sure
      it would have turned out perfectly, too.
